## ESP32

1. Take ESP32 flash download tool from this location: https://www.espressif.com/en/support/download/other-tools <br>
You might also need to install:
* a [driver for the CP210X USB to UART bridge from Silicon Labs](https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers) or
* [CH9102F driver](https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/CH9102_Driver)<br>
prior to first use of the ESP32 tool ;
2. Download an appropriate version of SoftRF firmware from [this location](https://github.com/lyusupov/SoftRF/tree/master/software/firmware/binaries/ESP32) and unzip the archive ;

3. Select COM port, enter partition files and addresses, select options ;<br>

   Here is an example:<br>

4. Press **START** button and wait for completion.

For some boards you may need to push **BOOT** button in order to activate flash download mode.<br>
"Stock" modules may also require to apply full flash memory erase (use **ERASE** UI "button") prior to first flashing with SoftRF's firmware.

<br>

## CubeCell

1. Take **CubeCellflash** for Windows <sub>_(Linux and MacOS variants are also available there)_</sub> download tool from this location: https://resource.heltec.cn/download/<br>
You might also need to install a [driver for the CP210X USB to UART bridge from Silicon Labs](https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers) prior to first use of the CubeCellflash tool ;
2. Download an appropriate version of SoftRF firmware from [this location](https://github.com/lyusupov/SoftRF/tree/master/software/firmware/binaries/ASR650x) and unzip the archive ;

<br>

## nRF52840

The board typically comes with factory pre-installed [Adafruit_nRF52_Bootloader](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_nRF52_Bootloader).<br>
The Bootloader is capable to self-program an application firmware into the device. In order to simplify the firmware transfer, the bootloader emulates a "USB Mass Storage" interface.

1. Download an appropriate version of SoftRF firmware from [this location](https://github.com/lyusupov/SoftRF/tree/master/software/firmware/binaries/nRF52840/SoftRF/MassStorage) ;

2. Connect the SoftRF Badge Edition device to your PC by means of a USB cable (Type-A <-> Type-C) ;

3. Double click (within 0.5 seconds) onto the SoftRF device RESET button. A virtual disk with **NRF52BOOT** (or **TECHOBOOT**) label should appear in your "File manager" afterwards.

4. Drag the downloaded firmware file by your pointing device (mouse, trackball,...) , then drop it into **NRF52BOOT** (or **TECHOBOOT**) disk. Wait until the file transfer is complete.

## LPC4320

For Linux and Mac OS X users, you will need a few tools installed on your computer before you begin:

* [dfu-util](http://dfu-util.sourceforge.net/) 0.8 or newer - Used to load and run the stock HackRF One firmware from RAM. dfu-util 0.8 is recommended, as it is the most extensively tested with the HackRF One hardware and build software.
* [hackrf](https://github.com/greatscottgadgets/hackrf) - All you need is the host tools, specifically, hackrf_spiflash.

### Backup of factory firmware

```
$ hackrf_spiflash -v -r HackRF_One_factory_firmware.bin
Reading 256 bytes from 0x000000.
Reading 256 bytes from 0x000100.

< ... skipped ... >

$ ls -la HackRF_One_factory_firmware.bin
-rw-r--r-- 1 pi pi 1048576 Nov  4 10:18 HackRF_One_factory_firmware.bin
```

### Flashing

1. Download an appropriate version of SoftRF firmware from [this location](https://github.com/lyusupov/SoftRF/tree/master/software/firmware/binaries/LPC4320) ;
2. Plug the HackRF One into a PC USB slot while holding down DFU button (the button closer to antenna jack). Release the DFU button, then execute:

```
$ dfu-util -D hackrf_one_usb.dfu --reset
$ hackrf_spiflash -v -w SoftRF-firmware-v1.1-LPC4320.bin
```

### Restore of HackRF One firmware

Plug the HackRF One into a PC USB slot while holding down DFU button (the button closer to antenna jack). Release the DFU button, then execute:

```
$ dfu-util -D hackrf_one_usb.dfu --reset
$ hackrf_spiflash -v -w HackRF_One_factory_firmware.bin
```

## ASR6601

1. Download an appropriate version of SoftRF firmware from [this location](https://github.com/lyusupov/SoftRF/tree/master/software/firmware/binaries/ASR6601) ;
2. Take a copy of **tremo_loader.py** script from [ASR SDK](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akarsh98/ASR6601-getting-started-guide/main/SDK/build/scripts/tremo_loader.py) ;
3. Connect an appropriate USB-Serial adapter to ASR6601 MCU pins as follows:

Adapter|MCU
---|---
GND|GND
3V3|VCC
TX|GPIO16
RX|GPIO17
DTR&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>|GPIO2
RTS|RESET

<sup>1</sup> - certain USB-Serial adapters may require to **invert DTR** signal either in hardware or in the Python script.<br>

4. Plug the USB-Serial adapter into spare USB slot of your PC ;
5. Use the loader tool to read the serial number of the MCU. This is a safety action to make sure that all the connections are good ;

```
$ python tremo_loader.py --port /dev/ttyUSB0 read_sn
Connecting...
Connected
The SN is: 0c15458cc5fb3201
```

6. Write the SoftRF firmware binary into flash memory of the ASR6601.

```
$ python tremo_loader.py --port /dev/ttyUSB0 flash 0x08000000 SoftRF-firmware-v1.1-ASR6601.bin
Connecting...
Connected
